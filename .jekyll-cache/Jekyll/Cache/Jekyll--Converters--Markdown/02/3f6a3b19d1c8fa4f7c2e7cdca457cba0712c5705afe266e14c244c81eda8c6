I"­<p>Architected, designed, and implemented a new web-based solution to
measure the councilorsâ€™ quality of service to the veterans. The system
utilizes Java EE technologies like web services to receive the data as
XML payload and a well-designed web front end to allow users to
respond to a set of questionnaires, depending on the kind of review
performed. The system shows the logic of the case reviews using
dynamic and static rules. The core technology stack used was IOC
library, Guice, by Google Labs for wiring loosely coupled services and
Controllers, and EJB3 technologies like Stateless Session beans and
persistence frameworks like JPA with Weblogic Kodo implementation
technology. The UI was rendered inside the Oracle Weblogic Portal
server using the Beehive framework, along with the Struts 1.3 web
framework. The UI used JSP with the JSTL core library, taglibs from
display tags, JQuery, iText for PDF rendering, and AJAX.</p>
