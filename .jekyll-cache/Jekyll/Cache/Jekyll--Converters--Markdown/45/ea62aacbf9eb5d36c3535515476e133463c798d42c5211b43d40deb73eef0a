I"z<p>Led the design and implementation of Inference Rule-based
transactional solution for EPA’s most massive Safe Drinking Water
Information System (SDWIS). SDWIS contains information about public
water systems and their violations of EPA’s drinking water
regulations, as reported to EPA by the states. These regulations
establish maximum contaminant levels, treatment techniques, and
monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure that water systems
provide safe water to their customers With this solution in place, the
states can upload information about public water systems to EPA. Once
reported the system is designed to find violations based on the EPA’s
drinking water regulations with very little human intervention. The
finished product determines water quality based on sample results,
thus regulating the monitoring requirements along with deciding about
different monitoring schedules the water facility has to comply with
until the water quality of samples returns with the compliance value
