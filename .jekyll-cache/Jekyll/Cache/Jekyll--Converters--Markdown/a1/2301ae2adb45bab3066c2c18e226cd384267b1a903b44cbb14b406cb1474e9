I"Å<p>Responsible for integrating worldâ€™s largest and best known EAM Asset
Management Software products, Infor, Bentley, and ESRI. Technologies
used are Java 8+, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Python,
Django, DjangoRestFramework, React JS, GraphQL, Docker,
Kubernetes, RedHat OpenShift, Keras, Tensorflow 2.0</p>
<ul>
  <li>At present, working on integration requirements of the initial phase
between Infor EAM and Bentley AssetWise for Metro North Rail, however
the integration design is one that will transfer to other agencies to
provide opportunities for expanded capabilities.</li>
  <li>NYMTA public buses have a mix of Gas driven and also electric buses.
The Electric buses charge kilowatt (KW) usage data needs to be
collected and stored in the NYMTA system of records (SOR). Kilowatts
from electric buses were manually downloaded from each charger in CSV
format from Siemens to be converted to a weekly excel report and
manually entered and tracked in SOR. The responsibility was to
automate the process between Siemens and NYMTA SOR. This applicationâ€™s
primary purpose is to pull the charge data from the Siemens system
automatically on demand.</li>
  <li>Single-handedly, designed a solution for the State of New Yorkâ€™s
largest transportation moversâ€™ supply-chain use-case. The application
is designed to provide an accurate picture of the current and
potential status of future inventory. Used machine learning to extract
knowledge and insights from data using Data Science and predictive
analytics to identify, assess, score risks, and find the refill days
after applying supervised learning for regression problems to predict
inventory level and how many of these items will sell over the next
variable time. Used React JS for the front end Web UI and of course,
used Reactive Native framework to design and implement the mobile
application with React Hooks, Context, and React Navigation following
Mobile devices design principles and methodologies</li>
