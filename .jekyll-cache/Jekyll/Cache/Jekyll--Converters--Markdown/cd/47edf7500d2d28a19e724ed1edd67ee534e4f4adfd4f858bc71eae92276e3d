I"¿<p>I was brought on board to design and implement the replacement of the
database-centric search with Google-based search using the Google
Search Appliance (GSA). One of the challenges was to replace the
entire search engine keeping the existing User Interface. On top of
this, the client also demanded to be able to search any changed or
newly added grant in real-time â€“ instantaneously. In addition to this
significant change, I also designed and implemented a solution where
information from the old legacy system and the new system could be
searched, rendered, updated, and deleted (CRUD) seamlessly. This new
feature was a requirement by the stakeholders in the middle of the
project and needed a thought. Without an experienced and passionate
brain, the project would not have been delivered without moving the
dates. The entire application would have to be, either, re-written or
broken into pieces where recovery would have been a big challenge</p>
