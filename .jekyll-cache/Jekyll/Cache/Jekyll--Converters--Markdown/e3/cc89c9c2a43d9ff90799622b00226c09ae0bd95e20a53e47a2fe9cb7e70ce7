I"ž<p>Designed various solutions to improve the performance and scalability
of machine generated code. The code converts from COBOL/CL on AS400
platform to Java pre-Java 8 code. Designed framework which bootstraps
a single-threaded code and intelligently partitions the code
vertically and runs the vertical partitions in parallel using
actor-based technology, Akka. Also applied an in-memory database to
pre-fetch data asynchronously and feed the data to the framework in
mini streams, thus improving the batch time by reducing elapsed time
from hours to only a few minutes. Technologies: Java 8, Redis 4,
Spring Boot, Spring Batch, Tomcat, Akka, Guice, Scala, Docker</p>
