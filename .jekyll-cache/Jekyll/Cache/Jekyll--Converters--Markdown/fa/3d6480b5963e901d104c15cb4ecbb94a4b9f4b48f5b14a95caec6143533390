I"Ê<p>Provided  solutions for a Full Stack Typescript Architecture for an
application that translates terminal interface with modern
functionality. Replaced an interface to the mainframe green screen
application which is not very user friendly. Additionally, any look up
information related to accounts/clients that they needed were spread
across multiple applications within the organization which resulted in
the users navigating between multiple systems to ultimately make the
decision on these exception items. With the new system in place, all
account information is gathered, exception and client data needed and
displayed to the user in an integrated web interface. This allows user
actions to be performed from this web interface without having to
navigate between multiple screens/systems. Technologies: Typescript,
NodeJS, NestJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS with Hooks and Redux, Sequelize,
lodash and other functional libraries, Docker, Kubernetes, RedHat
OpenShift</p>
