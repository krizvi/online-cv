        application which is not very user friendly. Additionally, any look up
        information related to accounts/clients that they needed were spread
        across multiple applications within the organization which resulted in
        the users navigating between multiple systems to ultimately make the
        decision on these exception items. With the new system in place, all
        account information is gathered, exception and client data needed and

        a single-threaded code and intelligently partitions the code
        vertically and runs the vertical partitions in parallel using
        actor-based technology, Akka. Also applied an in-memory database to
        pre-fetch data asynchronously and feed the data to the framework in
        mini streams, thus improving the batch time by reducing elapsed time

      details: |
        Led the design and implementation of Inference Rule-based
        transactional solution for EPA's most massive Safe Drinking Water
        Information System (SDWIS). SDWIS contains information about public
        water systems and their violations of EPA's drinking water
        regulations, as reported to EPA by the states. These regulations
        establish maximum contaminant levels, treatment techniques, and
        monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure that water systems
        provide safe water to their customers With this solution in place, the
        states can upload information about public water systems to EPA. Once
        reported the system is designed to find violations based on the EPA's
        drinking water regulations with very little human intervention. The
        finished product determines water quality based on sample results,
        thus regulating the monitoring requirements along with deciding about
        different monitoring schedules the water facility has to comply with
        until the water quality of samples returns with the compliance value
