      details: |
        Provided  solutions for a Full Stack Typescript Architecture for an
        application that translates terminal interface with modern
        functionality. Replaced an interface to the mainframe green screen
        application which is not very user friendly. Additionally, any look up
        information related to accounts/clients that they needed were spread
        across multiple applications within the organization which resulted in
        the users navigating between multiple systems to ultimately make the
        decision on these exception items. With the new system in place, all
        account information is gathered, exception and client data needed and
        displayed to the user in an integrated web interface. This allows user
        actions to be performed from this web interface without having to
        navigate between multiple screens/systems. Technologies: Typescript,

        of machine generated code. The code converts from COBOL/CL on AS400
        platform to Java pre-Java 8 code. Designed framework which bootstraps
        a single-threaded code and intelligently partitions the code
        vertically and runs the vertical partitions in parallel using
        actor-based technology, Akka. Also applied an in-memory database to
        pre-fetch data asynchronously and feed the data to the framework in
        mini streams, thus improving the batch time by reducing elapsed time
        from hours to only a few minutes. Technologies: Java 8, Redis 4,
        Spring Boot, Spring Batch, Tomcat, Akka, Guice, Scala, Docker

        this colossal batch system redesign by designing and implementing a
        flexible mechanism, where an external partner can be connected to the
        existing Loyalty program by following a flexible meta-dictionary.
        After the transformation, the system integrated seamlessly with
        several acquisitions and partnerships supporting Loyalty strategies to
        expand revenue growth rate. The target system supports regional

    title: COVID 19
    intro: >
      During the present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, those on the
      front lines—including health care professionals, researchers, and
      government experts—need quick, easy access to real-time critical data.
      This type of information exchange is what APIs do best. I designed and
      implemented a full-fledged web application that uses api.covid19api and
      render results in easy to understand graphical representations of current
      COVID 19 cases around the world
